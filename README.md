## CourseMate


### Inspiration: 
- Recognizing the difficulty of making friends at UBC, especially for students with social anxiety, we propose CourseMate to be a solution.
- CourseMate is an inclusive and accessible platform tailored for students with similar course schedules.
- Compatibility is determined by the likeness of schedules, creating an easy way to connect.
- CourseMate is a great starting point for conversations, fostering connections among students. 
- CourseMate also enables students to reach out for study buddies or assistance with course content.
- Building a supportive community for students facing the challenges of university life.


### How we built it? 
- Backend: We utilized Python to develop the backend of our project and Flask to combine the backend with our frontend, and Pickle for persistence.
- Frontend: For the frontend we utilized a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Challenges we ran into: 
- Due to the fact that Flask uses a lot of esoteric syntax, it was difficult to integrate frontend components utilizing HTML.
- It also proved to be difficult to design an aesthetically pleasing interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


### Accomplishments we’re proud of and what we learned:
- We built a fully functional app under 11.5 hours. 
- We all learned a lot when it comes frontend development, and it wasn’t just the basics, rather in our view, we made it very aesthetically pleasing.
- We all worked collaboratively, played to each other’s strengths, and didn’t hesitate to help one another in times of need. 

### What is next for CourseMate?
- Seamless Messaging: Effortlessly connect with fellow students across universities on the portal.
- Automated Data Input: Utilizing web scraping and API integration, CourseMate eliminates the need for manual data entry.
- Effortless Connectivity: Make groups and connect with people of similarly classed individuals without hassle.
- Universal Accessibility: Designed for use in all universities, CourseMate extends its benefits beyond UBC.
